  <s>
   Preferably use special carnivorous plant soil.
  </s>
  <s>
   Their habitats are hugely diverse, and some are far more adaptable growers than others.

  <s>
   You can monitor your humidity using a SensorPush unit, available on Amazon.

  <s>
   Nepenthes are very tolerant when it comes to soil.
  </s>
  <s>
   Nepenthes enjoy a loose, low-nutrition growing medium which keeps their roots aerated and allows excess water to quickly drain away while still retaining some moisture.
  </s>
  <s>
   Exactly how coarse your soil should be is dependent on numerous other factors, including ambient humidity, frequency of watering, and the species and age of your plant.
  </s>
  <s>
   Certain more challenging species - including some rare highland and ultra-highland Nepenthes - often benefit from a specific mixture which reflects soil's natural habitat (e.g. whether they grow terrestrially or as an ephiphyte).
  </s>
  <s>
   Aim to keep the soil damp at all times and never let it dry out completely.
  </s>
  <s>
   Unlike many other carnivores, Nepenthes are not bog plants and do not appreciate having waterlogged soil.
  </s>
  <s>
   Some growers stand soil's pots on a layer of plastic egg crate, which helps excess water drain away.
  </s>
  <s>
   Impurities can build up over time and will often accelerate the breakdown of your soil mixture.

   I've found N. Gaya, N. Bloody Mary, and N. x ventrata to be particularly forgiving, along with hybrids involving hairy species like N. veitchii.
  </s>
  <s>
   You can try to source smaller species such as N. glabrata, or slower growers like N. veitchii.
  </s>
  <s>
   N. veitchii is a beautiful species and one of my favourites, N. veitchii has traps with wide peristomes and is covered in fuzzy brown hair.

  <s>
   Its Latin name Dionaea muscipula partly commemorates Venus, the goddess of beauty.

  <s>
   Hardy carnivorous plants include Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), North American Trumpet Pitcher Plants (Sarracenia), Sundews (Drosera) and Cobra Lily (Darlingtonia), Bladderworts (Utricularia) and more.

   The Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is the only plant species that can count.
